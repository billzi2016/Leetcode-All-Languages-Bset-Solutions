# Project Structure

This document describes the recommended project layout and module responsibilities. Implementation should keep module boundaries clear and follow SOLID and DRY.

## Module Responsibilities

- `config.py`: Centralizes model name, think mapping, input/output paths, timeout, retry count, temperature, and other shared config.
- `dataset_loader.py`: Reads JSON, parses `questions`, filters by difficulty, and sorts problems by id.
- `prompt_builder.py`: Builds prompts, skips missing fields, and excludes `images`.
- `ollama_client.py`: Calls Ollama, handles model options, and returns raw code.
- `markdown_writer.py`: Builds target paths, formats Markdown, and writes files atomically.
- `logger.py`: Handles log formatting and stdout/stderr/failures separation.
- `resume.py`: Determines whether a problem or language has already been generated.
- `generator.py`: Coordinates modules and runs Easy -> Medium -> Hard sequentially.

## Tests

All unit tests live in `tests/` and use Python's standard `unittest` library.

Tests should cover:

- Dataset loading, missing fields, difficulty filtering, and problem-id sorting.
- Prompt construction, especially `images` exclusion, optional `solutions`, and language starter-code insertion.
- Markdown output paths, 100-problem buckets, filename format, and language section format.
- Easy/Medium write-once-per-problem behavior and Hard write-once-per-language behavior.
- Resume detection for complete problems and missing languages.
- stdout/stderr/failures log separation.
- Environment warning filtering for known requests dependency warnings.
- Retry-3 failure behavior that records logs and continues with the next problem.
- Ollama client usage through the Python `ollama` package, not `requests`.
- Ollama `hello` smoke tests for `low`, `medium`, and `high` think modes.
- Ollama options including a 100_000 token output limit and temperature `0.1`.
- CLI support for multiple problem ids, such as `--frontend-ids 1 2 4`.
- Formal-flow tests for LeetCode 1 / 2 / 4, covering Easy, Medium, and Hard, plus second-run skip behavior.

## SOLID

- Single Responsibility: each module handles one clear concern; prompt construction does not write files.
- Open/Closed: adding a model, output format, or language filter should usually be done through config or small modules, not by rewriting the main flow.
- Liskov Substitution: the model client should expose a stable interface so Ollama can be replaced without changing generation orchestration.
- Interface Segregation: callers should depend only on the methods they need.
- Dependency Inversion: orchestration depends on capabilities such as `ModelClient`, `Writer`, and `Logger`, not scattered low-level implementations.

## DRY

- The shared problem prompt is built once and reused across all languages for the same problem.
- Difficulty-to-think mapping is defined once in config.
- Output path and filename rules are implemented once in `markdown_writer.py`.
- Log formatting is defined once in `logger.py`.
- Resume checks are implemented once in `resume.py`.

Avoid copy-pasting path construction, prompt construction, retry logic, and Markdown formatting logic.
